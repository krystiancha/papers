In the present manuscript, the authors describe their experience with using the spherical camera for the robot testing in the simulation environment.

Furthermore, the paper has some major flaws that the referee points out next.

1 The paper title is misleading, it should be more concise

2. The authors stated:” The system was tested by comparing images generated in simulation with those gathered by the real robot.” It should be clearly described what metrics for evaluation were chosen.

3. The contribution of the paper needs to be stated clearly

4. In the conclusion section, the author stated: “Those results prove that using the proposed solution a set of spherical images can be used to replace a real robot in software testing.” But in the section Rendering performance mentioned:” A single 5376 × 2688 pixels JPEG image takes on average t = 198.672 ms to load and decode on our system. This further limits the FPS to 5 if the images are loaded synchronously.” 5 FPS is far not enough for real-time robot testing.

This s an interesting paper about a robot simulator based on a spherical camera. I found the paper abounding in interesting information.
I’m not sure if the reference list is exhaustive as there are hundreds of papers on spherical camera and robots. The same is with stating clearly the novelty of the solution.
The paper is generally well-written. I would advise to carefully check the paper as I found some possible minor errors. I’m not a native speaker so I could be wrong with these examples:

with existing robotic simulator.
in (the) case of service robots <- e.g. in case of fire
the robot itself(,) or in the worst(-)case scenario
move (the) robot back to the staring pose <- or starting
Using the 3D simulators gives (the) possibility of
generated using these equations: <- without „:”
Then(comma) the sphere has to be textured with the spherical
feature of (the) presented system
that it doesn’t replace <- we tend not to use contractions but it’s changing now
